Design and Optimization of a Bellmouth Intake for Ground-Based Test Rig Airflow Conditioning and Mass Flow Measurement in a Microturbojet Engine (EvoJet170neo)

This study presents the design and optimization of a bellmouth intake for a microturbojet engine (EvoJet170neo) intended for ground-based test rig applications. The design process employed numerical simulation utilizing the OpenFOAM computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The bellmouth geometry was defined by a parameterized elliptical profile, generated via computer-aided design (CAD) tools. Exploiting the inherent axisymmetry of the bellmouth, two-dimensional, axisymmetric simulations were conducted to reduce computational cost.

The airflow was modeled as incompressible, turbulent, and conforming to International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) sea-level conditions. The k-omega Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model was implemented, necessitating a meticulous mesh design. A hybrid mesh strategy was adopted, employing structured quadrilateral cells within boundary layer regions and unstructured triangular cells in the quiescent atmosphere. A mesh refinement study established that a minimum of 39 quadrilateral cells in the wall-normal direction, with a first-layer cell thickness of 0.0265717 m, was required to ensure a y+ value below 2, satisfying the turbulence model's requirements.

The optimized bellmouth design demonstrated effective airflow conditioning, maintaining attached boundary layers and achieving a homogeneous velocity field with deviations less than 1.8% of the mean flow velocity.

Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis was performed to determine optimal locations for total and static pressure probes, enabling accurate air mass flow rate estimation. This analysis included numerical validation and an investigation of the correlation between measured pressure and air mass flow across the engine's operational range. The sensitivity of measurements to probe positioning errors was also assessed. Results indicate a strong correlation between measured pressure and air mass flow at the selected probe locations, with minimal impact from positioning uncertainties.
